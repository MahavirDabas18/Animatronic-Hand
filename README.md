# Animatronic-Hand

## Description

Robotic Hand capable of mimicking real hand motions. 

### Components

* Flex Sensors- 3 Nos
* Arduino Uno R3- 1 No
* Servo Motors- 3 Nos
* 10 kilo ohm resistor- 3 No
* Coroplast Sheet
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires
* Threads
* Rubber Bands
* Glove

### Details

The basic components of the project are the the servos, the Arduino, the glove, and 
the flex sensors. The glove is mounted with flex sensors: variable resistors that 
change their value when bent. They're attached to one side of a voltage divider with 
resistors of a constant value on the other side. The Arduino reads the voltage 
change when the sensors are bent, and triggers the servos to move a proportional 
amount. The servos pull the strings that act as tendons, ultimately allowing the 
fingers to move.
